Day 1 of 100 Days of code, I jump to https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app/step-56 of freeCodeCamp since I know a bit of CSS, JS & HTML and I'm so excited to finish this up to the 100th day. I learned a lot about forms, inputs & sections. I'm currently working on a photocat app.
